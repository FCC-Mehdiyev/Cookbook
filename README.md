# Cookbook
### Part 1 of my Major Project Assignment


#### Who are the users of the software? 
Although this software is primarily aimed at users with a passion for cooking or baking, anyone that wants to save their recipes can use this software.


#### What is the purpose of the software?
The purpose of this software is to save cookbooks with recipes in them.


#### Where and when will the software be used?
This software can be used anytime and anywhere (as long as you have your laptop or computer).


#### How does the software work?
When you open this application, you will be prompted to either load or create a new cookbook. Once you get past that, you will be able to add new recipes, alongside their ingredients, and instructions. Furthermore, you can also create as many cookbooks as you want.


#### Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?
Compared to my competitors, my application will be easy to use and navigate and be usable without an internet connection.
